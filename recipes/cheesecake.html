        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Here is a cooking guide to making a plain yet delicious cheesecake!
                Cheesecakes are by far the superior cake in most situations. It
                is by far the best option when it comes to store bought cake. Wedding
                cakes suck let's be honest. Ice cream cakes are decent from time to time
                but they are a mess to eat. Ultimately, cheesecake wins by a long shot.

                    bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and
                     allow to cool.

                <p>In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar together until smooth. Beat in sour cream and heavy
                     cream. Blend in the flour and vanilla. With mixer on low speed, add eggs one at a time. Pour batter 
                     over crust.

        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
            <p>Here is a cooking guide to making some good old pizza! 
                I think we can all agree pizza is that one combination of ingridients that 
                we can't get tired of. It tastes so good and the variety 
                of pizza is immense. It is an easy to make dish that almost 
                everyone except psychopaths enjoy. Although, there are many types, 
                a classic oven baked pizza from Brooklyn is unbeatable.

            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
                <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
                <li>1 cup cold water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
                <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps class="steps"</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>1</li>
                    <p>Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes to proof. 
                        Stir in salt and cold water, then stir in the flour about 1 cup at a time. When the
                        dough is together enough to remove from the bowl, knead on a floured surface until 
                        smooth, about 10 minutes. Divide into two pieces, and form each one into a tight ball. 
                        Coat the dough balls with olive oil, and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. 
                        Be sure to use a big enough container to allow the dough to rise. Remove the dough from the refrigerator 
                        one hour prior to using.
                    </p>
                <li>2</li>
                    <p>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F. 
                        Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
                    </p>

                <li>3</li>
                    <p>Using one ball of dough at a time, lightly dust the dough with flour, and stretch gradually until it
                         is about 14 inches in diameter, or about as big around as the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.
                          Place thin slices of mozzarella over the crust, then grind a liberal amount of black pepper over it.
                           Sprinkle with dried oregano. Randomly arrange crushed tomatoes, leaving some empty areas. Drizzle 
                           olive oil over the top.
                    </p>

                <li>4</li>
                    <p>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure the dough will release from the peel easily. 
                        Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove peel so that
                         the pizza is left on the stone.
                    </p>

                <li>5</li>
                    <p>Bake for 4 to 6 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the crust begins to brown. 
                        Remove from the oven by sliding the peel beneath the pizza. Sprinkle a few basil leaves 
                        randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.
